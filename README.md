I like to work with service manual near me. At one point there were too many files acros many locations and few devices. 

This is bare bones simple program that has 4 columns for make, model, year and assembly. Its just showing folders and subfolders no magic.
Just create SmallSimpleManuals folder in /home and copy .py and .sh files there.
So for example this is folder structure scheme:

~/home/SmallSimpleManuals/Yamaha/R1/2006

This is something i have use of and it was created out of boredom.
